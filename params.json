{"name":"Juno","tagline":"OAuth2 based authentication service for credit unions and other financial institutions.","body":"### Juno\r\nJuno is a server application that provides authentication services and an application registry for applications that interact with financial institutions.  This is to allow these applications access to member information without requiring that the member give the application their login credentials. It is an integral part of the [Pennyminder](http://www.pennyminder.com/) platform.  \r\n\r\n### Cashbook\r\n\r\nJuno is required for our hosted PFM [Cashbook](http://www.pennyminder.com/cashbook.html).  We are developing additional applications that utilize Juno and they will be available soon.\r\n\r\n### License\r\nThe software is OpenSource and is licensed under the terms of the New BSD License. \r\n\r\n### Sponsor\r\nWe would like to thank [Mount Lehman Credit Union](https://www.mtlehman.com/) for graciously sponsoring the development of this software.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nWe can help with deploying Juno at your financial institution.
