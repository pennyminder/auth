Welcome to the Juno project!

Juno is a simple Ruby on Rails 3.0 web application that financial institutions
can run and host to allow third party applications access to their member's/client's
financial data without requiring those members/clients to hand over their login
information to the third party applications.  It is an Open Source project under
the terms and conditions of the New BSD License.

Juno authorises applications by using the emerging standard OAuth protocol.

Getting Started.

It's Rails...

1) Create database
2) Run migrations
3) run the server (rails s)
4) Implement Member Authentication and the register call backs API

What You Need To Implement

  Member Authentication


    Member Authentication is based on OmniAuth (https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/)
    You must implement a custom strategy that authenticates against your core (or online)
    banking system.

    See BLANK for an example

  Register Transaction Notification Callback API

    You must implement something that will record a URL for the supplied user) that will
    be called whenever a transaction is performed on a members account.  Code must also
    be implmented in your core system that will call this callback url whenever there is
    a transaction.

Thanks to our sponsor!

Our sponsor shall remain a mystery at this time, but this project
would not be possible without their support and help.
